# Challenge 5: Domo Arigato, AI Roboto

In the previous challenge, you got a taste for how AI can be used to provide guidance to the adjudicator. In this challenge, you will take it one step further by creating a SemanticFunction to automatically review, approve, deny or forward the claim to a manager, replacing the hardcoded rule logic currently used by the solution.

## Challenge

Your team must:

1. Create a new SemanticFunction to automatically review, approve, deny or forward the claim to a manager.
2. Modify the `CoreBusinessRule` class to implement the new SemanticFunction.
3. Generate new claims to test and verify the new SemanticFunction's capability to make claim decisions.

### Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you must:

- Have a working implementation of the new SemanticFunction that can make claim decisions.
- Integrate the SemanticFunction into your solution.
- Successfully generate new claims and verify that the SemanticFunction is making claim decisions.
