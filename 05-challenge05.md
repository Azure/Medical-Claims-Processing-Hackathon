# Challenge 5: Domo Arigato, AI Roboto

In the previous challenge, you got a taste for how AI can be used to provide guidance to the adjudicator. In this challenge, you will take it one step further by creating a Semantic Kernel plugin to automatically review, approve, deny, or forward the claim to a manager, replacing the hardcoded rule logic currently used by the solution.

## Challenge

Your team must:

1. Create a new Semantic Kernel plugin to automatically review, approve, deny or forward the claim to a manager.
2. Modify the `RulesEngine` class to implement the new plugin.
3. Generate new claims to test and verify the new plugin's capability to make claim decisions.

### Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you must:

- Have a working implementation of the new Semantic Kernel plugin that can make claim decisions.
- Integrate the plugin into your solution.
- Successfully generate new claims and verify that the plugin is making claim decisions.
