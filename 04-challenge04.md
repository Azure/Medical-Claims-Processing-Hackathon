# Challenge 4: Adding adjudicator guidance

In this challenge, you will augment the functionality of the Claim Details pane by providing the adjudicator with AI generated guidance on what action to take. 

You will use the Microsoft Semantic Kernel with Azure OpenAI to create a SemanticFunction that will respond with guidance for the claim. To accomplish this, examine the ReviewClaim function in the CoreClaims.SemanticKernel project, which has some placeholder code for you to complete.

After creating the SemanticFunction, you will run the solution, select a claim to adjudicate and view the guidance provided to you by the language model.
